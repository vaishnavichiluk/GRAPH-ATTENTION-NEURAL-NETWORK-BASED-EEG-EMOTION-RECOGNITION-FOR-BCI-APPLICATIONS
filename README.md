# GRAPH-ATTENTION-NEURAL-NETWORK-BASED-EEG-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-FOR-BCI-APPLICATIONS
Developed an EEG-based emotion recognition model using Graph Attention Networks to understand how different brain-signal channels interact. Converted EEG data into graph structures and applied attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy of emotional state classification for BCI applications.
